# Restaurant-management-System

 In the Restaurant Management system, we were given certain conditions which we had to fulfil. We aimed to make a restaurant management system which is fully automated, and all the processes which involve any human labour are reduced to minimum amount.
Before coming to the restaurant, the person should have reserved the table using his/her login
He gets a reservation id for the same and is allocated a table based on the number of people arriving.
After coming to the restaurant he can order from the menu on the app/website.
Order is assigned to table as soon as table is reserved.
 These steps cut short the work of manager, receptionist and many more, as soon as he places order on his account, he is assigned a waiter and gets the information about the chef.
Bill is generated as soon as order status turns to ‘order served’ .
Payment which is paid by customer gets offer based on two constraints. First, based on the offer which is active and on the basis of payment mode of the customer is payment status is ‘unpaid’.
 Admin can also login and see the history of the customers and many more activities. The restaurant system which we have created has automated the whole system.
